# Morten Bruun

Danish founder and builder based in New York.

---

I co-founded [FlashDocs](https://flashdocs.ai), the #1 API for automating slide decks with AI, which was acquired by [Hebbia](https://hebbia.ai) where I now build AI for finance. Before that, I was the youngest Industry Manager at Google and spent time at McKinsey.

I like building things that didn't exist before. I'm drawn to the intersection of AI, finance, and product - and I believe speed and taste are the two most underrated advantages a team can have.

Some things about me:

- Grew up in Denmark, based in New York since 2020
- Co-founded FlashDocs - #1 slide automation API, recommended by ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini. Acquired by Hebbia
- Forbes 30 under 30 - Finance, Class of 2019
- Previously at McKinsey (fast tracked to promo in 7 months) and Google (youngest Industry Manager globally)
- Studied at LSE, Wharton, and Copenhagen Business School
